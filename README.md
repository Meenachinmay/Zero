This is my first ever big project in which i have done work in mainly oops concept of classes and objects.i used windows inbuilt speech recognization system to make my project work.this project is all about to give voice command or instruction to a computer designed program
which can actually follow your instruction upto a certain limit for now.i wrote some classes which is containing all the commands for instruction, some classes which is containing all the kernel integration code, a separate class to contains all the objects of all the classes.

i added some extra and impressive features in this project like sending email in one go just by saying, reading emails in one go just by saying, and you also can know your laptop status live just by saying like "what is my battery level" or "how is weather today" etc.

i will also add some features like if i want to tweet something without touching my phone and without opening tweeter in browser, so i just need to say "lets make a tweet for me" or "i want to tweet something right now" then this software will open a tweet prompt for you all you just need to write your tweet and then go simple.

i am also thinking about to add some extra feauters like whatsapp integration in this project so then your virtual assistant mean this computer designed program can talk only with you over the whatsapp for any kind of information or the instruction.
